# IST-ETeo-Lab4 2021/2022 | [Transient regimes](et2022_lab4.pdf)

In this study, we explore the behavior of electrical circuits during transient regimes, which occur when switches are operated. The switching events introduce changes in circuit parameters, leading to temporary deviations from the steady-state behavior. Specifically, we examine two scenarios:

- Study of RL-Series Circuit Connected to Sinusoidal Alternating Voltage Generator: We analyze the behavior of an RL-series circuit when connected to a sinusoidal alternating voltage generator. This investigation aims to understand the transient response of the circuit upon the initial connection.

- Study of Free (Natural) Transient Regime in RLC-Series Circuit: We explore the behavior of an RLC-series circuit under free transient conditions. In this scenario, the circuit is initially charged or energized and left to respond to the changes without any external excitation.
